================================================================================

ProteinShop is an interactive tool for manipulating protein structures. 
It was designed to quickly create a diverse set of initial configurations 
for a given sequence of amino acids. These configurations can be used as 
starting points to a global optimization algorithm. Although ProteinShop 
does not perform the global optimization process itself, it provides a 
framework that can be used to interact with a global optimization process 
that may be running on a remote machine. 

    * 	It helps researchers automatically generate tertiary structures from sequence
		and secondary structure predictions available from prediction 
		servers accessible via the Internet.
    * 	It enables scientists to apply their biochemical knowledge and intuition 
		during interactive manipulation of protein structures.
    * 	It provides visualization of free energy computed during modeling to 
		facilitate comparison and analysis of alternative structures.
    * 	It accelerates the discovery of low-energy configurations by applying 
		local optimizations to user-selected protein structures.
    *   It automatically creates a variety of beta configurations based on probabilities
   		for beta sheet topologies and matching alignments.

About ProteinShop
--------------------------------------

ProteinShop was developed by researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National 
Laboratory, University of California at Davis, and Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory. ProteinShop can create a protein "from scratch" using its amino acid 
sequence and secondary structure predictions. Also, ProteinShop can load a 3D 
protein structure from data files in PDB (Protein Data Bank) format. Furthermore, 
it allows the interactive manipulation of the 3D protein structure by changing 
dihedral angles along its backbone. Protein structures created and/or 
manipulated with ProteinShop can be saved to data files in PDB format.

ProteinShop allows manual interaction guided by an externally provided 
energy function.

ProteinShop can be used to monitor and steer the progress of a 
(remote) global optimization process by visualizing downloaded configurations, 
manipulating them to achieve a desired fold, and loading them back to 
the optimization process.

ProteinShop presents three levels of functionality

Level I: Display a 3D protein structure
	* 	Create a 3D protein "from scratch", i.e., one amino acid at a time, 
		from an amino acid sequence and secondary structure predictions.
	*	Load a  3D protein structure from a PDB file.
	*	Provide standard visualization techniques such as atom sphere, 
		bond stick, and cartoon rendering.

Level II: Interactive manipulation of the 3D protein structure by changing
	 	dihedral angles along its backbone
	*	Manual secondary structure alignment by dragging selected secondary 
		structures (alpha-helices and beta-strands).
	*	Change the shape of beta-strands by allowing twisting, curling, and 
		pleating.
	*	Form parallel/antiparallel beta-sheets automatically.
	*	Save/load fragments of the protein for reuse in other configurations.
	*	Help align secondary structures to form tertiary structures by providing 
		visualization guides and markers such as hydrogen bond rendering and atom 
		collision visualization.
	*	Change secondary structure  types for selected amino acids "on-the-fly" 
		to experiment with weak or conflicting secondary structure predictions.
	*	Evaluate the energy of a 3D protein structure using externally provided 
		energy computation code.
	*	Visualize calculated energy.

Level III: Monitor/steer a (remote) global optimization process
	*	Connect to / disconnect from a global optimization process.
	*	Download candidate configurations from an optimization process.
	*	Upload manipulated configurations to optimization process.
	*	Monitor optimization process by downloading entire tree of configurations.


What's new in version 3.0?
--------------------------------------

	*	ProteinShop allows multiple proteins to be manipulated in the same 
		environment. This allows comparative analysis of adjoining tertiary 
		structures during the interactive manipulation process.	The user
		can load either all the chains or a specific
		chain/model in a PDB file. 
	*	A new color representation for hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and disulfide 
		residues.
	*	New line, CPK, and tube rendering methods.
	*	New labeling system for displaying information of protein structures such as 
		atom and residue names, model and chain ID, energy value, and RMSD. 
	*	Use of the Ramachandran plot to change dihedral angles of a
		selected residue directly.
	* 	A new UI for aligning two structures and calculating RMSD. 	
	*	New "BuildBeta" tool for automatically creating
		initial beta-sheet conformations.
	*	New "Copy" tool for copying a fragment from a protein structure.
	*	New energy visualization using volume rendering.
	*	The energy value is continuously updated during a manipulation and
		displayed on the screen.

Library Dependencies
--------------------------------------

ProteinShop requires several libraries for various of its functions.
	1. OpenGL or GL for 3-D rendering
  	2. FLTK for GUI		http://www.fltk.org/
	3. AMBER for energy computation 
		(pre-built AMBER libraries for Linux and Mac are included)

Other libraries are required by ProteinShop's energy features.
Please visit the ProteinShop web site for more information:
http://proteinshop.lbl.gov/Index.html



Building ProteinShop from source
--------------------------------------

Use standard Makefiles included in the src directory.
Go to the "src' directory then type 'make' to build ProteinShop. 

***	FLTK setting in the Makefile
The compiler expects include files under $(FLTK_BASE)/$(INCDIR),
libraries under $(FLTK_BASE)/$(LIBDIR), and any needed build tools
under $(FLTK_BASE)/$(BINDIR). If you have a different setup,
you need to hand-edit the compiler flags below.

FLTK_BASE = /usr/local

On some installations, Fltk OpenGL functions are in a separate
library, libfltk_gl. If the linker complains about undefined
symbols, try adding -lfltk_gl to the line below before -lfltk.

FLTK_LIBS = -L$(FLTK_BASE)/$(LIBDIR) -lfltk_gl -lfltk



Documentation
--------------------------------------

The User's Guide is available along with this program under the Documentation
directory.
