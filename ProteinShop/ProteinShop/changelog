nmz787 - 21 September 2013
downloaded version 3.1.1 of ProteinShop from sourceforge (sourceforge.net/projects/proteinshop/files/proteinshop/ProteinShop3.1.1/)
deleted Geometry Math and Misc directories and replaced them with the latest (v3.0 http://idav.ucdavis.edu/~okreylos/ResDev/Geometry/Download.html)

Then I had to change Globals.cpp line 75 from
char *ext = strrchr(basename, '.');
to:
char const *ext = strrchr(basename, '.');

Then in SpaceBall.h I had to change:
<string> 
to:
<string.h>

downloaded and installed g77 via (http://askubuntu.com/questions/346278/really-need-g77-on-ubuntu-12-04-cant-install)

modified CFLAGS in the Makefile, I commented out the line:
CFLAGS = -g0 -03 -DNDEBUG
and changed it to just:
CFLAGS = -g

I added:
template ComponentArray<float,3>::ComponentArray(const ComponentArray<float,4>&);
after line 62 in src/Geometry/ComponentArray.cpp

Dependencies (at least the things I installed)

g77 (included... run ./install.sh)
