<h1>Rendering Features</h1>
<p>ProteinShop supports several basic rendering modes for protein
structures, and several manipulation guides that are designed to
assist a user in creating "good" protein structures. All
rendering features can be toggled on/off either via hotkeys, or via
the <a href="DialogWindowReference.html#DrawingTogglesDialog">Drawing
Toggles Dialog</a>. Most features can be toggled both globally for an
entire protein or on a per-structure basis. If a rendering feature
can be toggled per structure and has a hotkey, it can be toggled for
the currently selected structure by holding down the <b>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</b>&nbsp;modifier
key and pressing the appropriate hotkey for the global setting.</p>
<p>Rendering modes can be combined arbitrarily (leading to more or
less useful results). Features that have both a global and
per-structure setting are enabled only if both settings are turned
on. For example, hydrogen bond site rendering is, per default,
disabled globally and enabled per-structure for all beta-strands in a
protein. If the feature is then enabled globally, all beta-strands
will be rendered with hydrogen bond sites. </p>
<h2>Protein Rendering Modes</h2>
<p>ProteinShop's basic protein rendering modes are modeled after
those found in other molecular visualization packages. </p>
<h3>Van-der-Waals Spheres</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In this rendering mode, each atom
inside a protein is rendered as a sphere, see Figure&nbsp;1. The
radius of a sphere is the van-der-Waals radius of its atom's element.
Spheres are colored according to standard usage in chemical
visualization programs and textbooks. This rendering mode can be
toggled globally or per structure, via one of the "Draw atoms"
toggles in the <a
 href="DialogWindowReference.html#DrawingTogglesDialog">Drawing
Toggles Dialog</a> or via the <b>a</b>&nbsp;hotkey. </p>

<h3>Bond Sticks</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In this mode, each covalent bond inside
a protein is rendered as a two-color cylinder of fixed radius, see
Figure&nbsp;2. Each cylinder half is colored according to the element
of the atom at that end of the cylinder. This rendering mode can be
toggled globally or per structure, via one of the "Draw side
chain bonds" toggles in the <a

<h3>Structure Cartoons</h3>
<p>In this mode, only a protein's backbone is rendered to reduce
occlusion and visual clutter, see Figure&nbsp;3. ProteinShop uses
different glyphs to visually distinguish the three basic secondary
structure types: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Alpha-helices are rendered as
helices of thick ribbons in a red-purple color. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Beta-strands are rendered as thick
arrows in a blue-purple color. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Coil regions are rendered as cylindrical tubes in a purple
color. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">This rendering mode can be toggled
globally or per structure, via one of the "Draw structure
cartoons" toggles in the <a

<h2>Manipulation Guides</h2>
<p>ProteinShop supports several rendering features that are designed
to provide guidance during protein manipulation. The first three
guides are concerned with forming backbone-to-backbone hydrogen
bonds; the last is concerned with removing interferences between
atoms. </p>
<h3>Hydrogen Bonds</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">When this feature is enabled,
ProteinShop constantly monitors the position/orientation of all
backbone N-H and C=O groups, and detects any hydrogen bonds between
any pair of opposingly charged groups in real-time. Hydrogen bonds
will be rendered as bold dashed yellow lines between the hydrogen and
oxygen atom positions of the involved N-H and C=O groups, see
Figure&nbsp;7. ProteinShop does not check for hydrogen bonds
involving partially charged sidechain groups. This rendering mode can
be toggled globally only, via the the "Draw hydrogen bonds"
toggle in the <a href="DialogWindowReference.html#DrawingTogglesDialog">Drawing
Toggles Dialog</a> dialog or via the <b>h</b>&nbsp;hotkey. </p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="16" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <p align="center"><br>
      <br>

and oxygen atoms of a pair of backbone N-H and C=O groups that are in a
valid relative position/orientation.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>ProteinShop uses a simplified geometrical model to determine
whether two opposingly charged backbone groups form a hydrogen bond.
If the two groups' atoms are denoted as N, H, C, and&nbsp;O, then the
two groups form a hydrogen bond if, and only if, </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">the distance between N and&nbsp;O is
between 2.7 and&nbsp;3.2 Angstrom, </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">the distance between H and&nbsp;O is
between 1.7 and&nbsp;2.35 Angstrom, and </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the angle between the line connecting N and&nbsp;H and the line
connecting H and&nbsp;O is not larger than 45&nbsp;degrees. </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the C=O group's carbon atom is not considered. </p>
<h3>Hydrogen Bond Sites</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Hydrogen bond rendering only visualizes
formed hydrogen bonds, but does not provide guidance about how to
form them. Hydrogen bond sites are simple visual guides for this
purpose, see Figure&nbsp;8. A hydrogen bond site is the midpoint
between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms involved in an "average"
hydrogen bond. When hydrogen bond site rendering is enabled,
ProteinShop draws a line segment connecting the hydrogen or oxygen
atom of each backbone N-H or C=O group to its respective bond site.
The bond site itself is highlighted by a dot. A charged group's line
segment and dot are colored according to polarity: Bond sites of N-H
groups are colored cyan; bond sites of C=O groups are colored red.
This rendering mode can be toggled globally or per structure, via one
of the "Draw hydrogen bond sites" toggles in the <a
 href="DialogWindowReference.html#DrawingTogglesDialog">Drawing
Toggles Dialog</a> or via the <b>s</b>&nbsp;hotkey. </p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="16" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <p align="center"><br>
      <br>
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img
 src="RenderingFeaturesHydrogenBondSites.png" name="Graphic5"
 align="bottom" border="0" height="335" width="450"></p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <p><b>Figure 8:</b> Visualization of hydrogen bond sites.
Hydrogen bond sites are rendered as line segments between a backbone
N-H or C=O group's outer atom (hydrogen or oxygen) and the midpoint of
a potential "average" hydrogen bond involving that group. The potential
midpoint is highlighted by a dot. Hydrogen bond sites are colored
according to their group's outer atom (cyan for N-H, red for C=O).</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>As the result, two opposingly charged groups will form a hydrogen
bond if their bond site dots are close to each other, and their bond
site line segments point away from each other. The problem of
aligning two structures to form hydrogen bonds is therefore reduced
to overlaying pairs of differently colored dots. Compare Figures 7
and&nbsp;8 for two renderings of an identical alignment, the first
with hydrogen bonds and the second with hydrogen bond sites
visualized. </p>
<h3>Hydrogen Bond Cages</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Hydrogen bond sites as described above
provide good guidance for rapid creation of coarse alignments, but
they sometimes lack the needed precision to form many hydrogen bonds
between two structures. Hydrogen cages, see Figure&nbsp;9, are a more
precise representation of the regions of space ProteinShop considers
valid for forming hydrogen bonds. A hydrogen cage is a yellow
wireframe cage around the region of space the oxygen atom of a
backbone C=O group has to fall into to form a hydrogen bond with the
backbone N-H group associated with the cage. In hydrogen cage
rendering, oxygen atoms of backbone C=O groups are rendered as red
dots at the oxygen atom's position, and a red line segment connecting
the oxygen and the carbon atom. This rendering mode can be toggled
globally or per structure, via one of the "Draw hydrogen cages"
toggles in the <a
 href="DialogWindowReference.html#DrawingTogglesDialog">Drawing
Toggles Dialog</a> or via the <b>c</b>&nbsp;hotkey. </p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="16" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <p align="center"><br>
      <br>
      </p>

group's hydrogen atom, surrounding the region of space a backbone C=O
group's oxygen atom has to fall into for the two groups to form a
hydrogen bond.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Due to their size and complexity, hydrogen cages can lead to
visual clutter. ProteinShop supports an alternative rendering mode
that only draws the outer shell of each hydrogen cage, reducing the
amount of geometry rendered. Rendering of small hydrogen cages can be
toggled on a per-structure basis only, via the "Draw small
hydrogen cages" toggle in the <a
 href="DialogWindowReference.html#DrawingTogglesDialog">Drawing
Toggles Dialog</a> or via the <b>&lt;Ctrl&gt;+l</b>&nbsp;hotkey. </p>
<h3>Atom Collisions</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">ProteinShop ignores atom-atom
interferences during manipulation. This provides more freedom for
interaction, and allows to change parts of an already assembled
protein structure with ease. However, before a protein structure can
be submitted for optimization or other post-processing, it is usually
necessary to clean up "bad" interferences. To assist in
clean-up, ProteinShop provides a feature that tests any pair of atoms
inside a protein for collisions in real-time during manipulation, and
visualizes any occurring collisions, see Figure&nbsp;10. Two atoms
are considered to collide if their distance is less than
0.75&nbsp;times
the sum of their van-der-Waals radii. A colliding atom pair is
visualized by rendering a red " collision sphere" at the
midpoint between the two atoms. The collision sphere's radius is
proportional to the penetration depth of the two atoms' van-der-Waals
spheres. This rendering mode can be toggled globally only, via the
the "Draw atom collisions" toggle in the <a
 href="DialogWindowReference.html#DrawingTogglesDialog">Drawing
Toggles Dialog</a> or via the <b>p</b>&nbsp;hotkey. </p>
