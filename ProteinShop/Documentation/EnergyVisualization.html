<H1>Energy Computation and Visualization</H1>
<P>One of our initial goals with ProteinShop was to create initial
structures for subsequent global internal energy minimization.
Therefore, it was desirable to support on-the-fly calculation of a
protein structure's internal energy using the same energy function as
inside the optimization algorithm. This would allow judging the
overall quality of manipulated protein structures during creation, to
cull undesirable structures as early in the process as possible. To
make ProteinShop useful in a more general context, it was later
decided to replace the fixed energy computation module with a plug-in
system that would allow coupling ProteinShop with any external energy
computation code.&nbsp; In an even more general sense, it is even
possible to couple ProteinShop with <EM>any</EM> computation module
that takes the set of 3D cartesian coordinates of all atoms inside a
protein into account and delivers a real number quantifying the
&quot;desirability&quot; of a structure.

<H2>Energy computation plug-in.</H2>
<P>Proteinshop includes the Amber plug-in to compute the AMBER energy
(<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Link&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dbFrom=PubMed&amp;from_uid=14531054">AMBER</A>)&nbsp;
of a protein and to perform <A HREF="#LOCAL_MIN">local minimization</A>
of this energy.&nbsp;&nbsp; The energy computation is based on the
AmberEngine library.&nbsp; This library was developed with
ProteinShop in mind, but it is not specific to ProteinShop.&nbsp;&nbsp;
To compute the AMBER energy of a protein, the AmberEngine initializes
a set of internal vectors based on the PDB file of the protein (for
this purpose, the PDB file must be in a <A HREF="#PDB_REQUIREMENTS">specific
format.</A>)&nbsp; After initialization, all energy computations
require only the vector of atoms coordinates.&nbsp; In addition to
the total AMBER energy value,&nbsp; AmberEngine&nbsp; makes available
to ProteinShop the <A HREF="#PER_ATOM">energy per-atom</A> for
visualization, as well as the partial <A HREF="#ENERGY_COMPONENTS">energy
components</A> that make up the AMBER model.&nbsp; The user can then
select which energy to visualize and can identify high-energy atoms
inside the protein.&nbsp; 
</P>
<H3><A NAME="PDB_REQUIREMENTS"></A>PDB File Format requirements for
Energy Computations.</H3>
<P>The current energy computation plug-in requires that the PDB file
for the protein satisfies the following two format requirements:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The ordering of the atoms in each
	amino acid should be the same as the ordering used in the amino
	files in the Standards directory. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The PDB file should include all
	the hydrogen atoms. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>A residue cap (ACE/NME residue) should be added at each
	end of the amino acid sequence. ProteinShop will check the PDB file
	and add these residues automatically if they are missing.</P>
</UL>
<P>Note that ProteinShop will read any PDB file, regardless of the
ordering and insertion of the hydrogen atoms. These format
requirements are only necessary for the preprocessing that calculates
the AMBER energy.</P>
<H3><A NAME="PER_ATOM"></A>Atom-Based Energy Visualization</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">ProteinShop energy visualization
interface allows visualization of the computed energy-values in a
per-atom basis. The basic idea is that the energy computation module
can compute a partial (energy) value for each atom inside a protein.
These per-atom values can then be visualized, for instance, by
mapping colors to atoms' van-der-Waals spheres, see Figure&nbsp;1.
This kind of view can be produced by selecting the <I>Draw atoms</I>
toggle in the <I>Drawing Toggles Dialog</I> and the <I>Visualize
energy</I> toggle in the 
<A HREF="DialogWindowReference.html#EnergyVisualizationDialog">Energy
Visualization Dialog</A>.</P>

</TABLE>
<P><BR>Even though most existing computation codes do not compute
per-atom values, many can easily be augmented to do so. For example,
a code that calculates internal energy based on interactions between
n-tuples of atoms could &quot;localize&quot; its computed internal
energy by splitting the energy contributions computed for each
n-tuple between the n&nbsp;atoms involved. For example, a code that
considers bond angles could split the calculated partial energy
values evenly among the three atoms forming the bond angle.&nbsp;
This is the approach currently used by the AmberEngine plug-in to
compute per-atom energies.</P>
<P>ProteinShop also supports energy visualization based on volume
textures superimposed over the geometric protein model. The use of
this feature is described in detail by the <A HREF="evpug/index.html">Energy
Visualization Pipeline User's Guide</A>.

<H3><A NAME="ENERGY_COMPONENTS"></A>Partial Energy Components</H3>
<P>To provide even more insight, the AmberEngine module keeps track
of separate energy components that make up AMBER, namely the energy
terms based on bond distances, bond angles, dihedral angles, and
non-bonded interactions.&nbsp;&nbsp; ProteinShop allows the user to
toggle energy components separately for visualization.&nbsp; This
enables a user to better find and understand energy &quot;hot spots&quot;
in a protein, for example by looking for only undesirable dihedral
angles, or only for bad non-bonded interferences.</P>
<H3><A NAME="LOCAL_MIN"></A>Local Energy Minimization</H3>
<P>In addition to energy computations, the Amber plug-in provides an
optimization routine to start a local minimization of the protein's
energy.&nbsp; See the <A HREF="DialogWindowReference.html#EnergyVisualizationDialog">Energy
Visualization Dialog</A>. This optimization is performed using the
Limited Memory BFGS algorithm (<A HREF="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=83726&amp;dl=ACM&amp;coll=portal">LBFGS</A>)&nbsp;
as implemented in the <A HREF="http://csmr.ca.sandia.gov/projects/opt++/">OPT++
toolkit</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; In ProteinShop, this feature allows
real-time visualization of the protein energy minimization process
that drives the protein folding process.&nbsp;&nbsp;
