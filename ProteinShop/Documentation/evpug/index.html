The energy visualization system renders force fields as a semitransparent cloud
around the various geometric tinkertoys that can be used to display molecular
structure.  Where the cloud is thickest, the forces are strongest.  Where the
cloud is thin or nonexistent, the forces are reaching equilibrium.  Rendering is
straightforward, done by hardware with volume textures.  You control the
resolution detail of the texture and all important aspects of the transfer
function, which is tailored to <TT>ProteinShop</TT>'s functionality.

<P>
The energy rendering system is built on top of <TT>ProteinShop</TT>'s older energy
visualization feature (based on colored atom spheres), which remains available.
In particular, the controls for that system are also used by the this system.
Including both the original settings and the new ones added for this system, you
have a total of eight settings to control the transfer function and determine
the general appearance and information conveyed by the energy cloud.  The
assemblage of these settings is illustrated below.

<OL>
<LI><A NAME="channel"></A> <B>Channel</B>:  You can show either the subset sum of the
energy terms selected in the discriminator (<A HREF="#discriminator">2</A>), or the subset
sum of their gradient magnitudes.  You control the channel through the <EM>Input Channel</EM> toggles in the <EM>Energy Rendering Dialog</EM>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A NAME="discriminator"></A> <B>Discriminator</B>:  This is the block of toggles
labeled <EM>Visualized Energy Components</EM> in the <EM>Energy Visualization
Dialog</EM>.  You can use these toggles to select an arbitrary subset of the energy
component terms to be visualized.  Those not selected will be ignored.  This
setting and the clamp (<A HREF="#clamp">3</A>) are part of <TT>ProteinShop</TT>'s original energy
visualization functionality.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A NAME="clamp"></A> <B>Clamp</B>:  This is the <EM>Energy Mapping Range</EM>
interval in the <EM>Energy Visualization Dialog</EM>.  If <EM>Max</EM> is no more than
<EM>Min</EM>, it defaults to <EM>Min</EM> + 100.  This interval helps eliminate
outliers from the data, which might otherwise hide detailed information
elsewhere.  Its exact effect is detailed below.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A NAME="resolution"></A> <B>Resolution</B>:  Use the <EM>Texels per angstrom</EM>
slider in the <EM>Energy Rendering Dialog</EM> to control the resolution of the texture.  The resolution
you select may be automatically lowered to observe constraints imposed by your
platform's OpenGL rendering capabilities and the value of the variable <TT>EnergyCalculator/maxBuffer</TT> in <TT>ProteinShop.cfg</TT>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A NAME="radial-specifier"></A> <B>Radial specifier</B>:  Use the <EM>Radius
multiplier</EM> slider and the <EM>Radial Basis Function Coefficient Type</EM> toggles
in the <EM>Energy Rendering Dialog</EM> to control the radius of the basis function, which determines how
much an atom's energy spreads into the texture.  The coefficient type can be
either uniform or relative; in the latter case, equal to either of each atom's
physical or Van der Waals radius.  The final radius is defined in angstroms.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A NAME="classifier"></A> <B>Classifier</B>:  Use the <EM>Classifier</EM> menu in the
<EM>Energy Rendering Dialog</EM> to select one classification function, which maps atoms to a limited range
of integers [0,<EM>m</EM>), where <EM>m</EM> is the number of classifications in the
function's range.  The classifier's domain consists of everything <TT>ProteinShop</TT> knows
about the atoms, including their element types, positions, topological
relationships, current force field states, and the secondary structures and
residues to which they belong.  Three classifiers are provided in this release,
detailed below. More can easily be added, also detailed below.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A NAME="normalizing-interval"></A> <B>Normalizing interval</B>:  Use the <EM>Energy Rendering Dialog</EM> to
control this interval, which determines how the cumulative atom energy values
from the input channel are normalized into the domain of the color function
(<A HREF="#color-function">8</A>).  It can be computed automatically based on the current
energy levels or set to an arbitrary value, according to the value of the <EM>Calculate automatically</EM> toggle.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><A NAME="color-function"></A> <B>Color function</B>:  Each integer in the
classifier's range is associated with a color function.  The color function maps
the atom's energy to a color.  The colors from all classifications are combined
in a weighted average to produce the final color and transparency of the
texture.  You can assign color functions to classifications using the box
immediately below the <EM>Classifier</EM> menu in the <EM>Energy Rendering Dialog</EM>.  The <EM>Next</EM> and
<EM>Previous Class</EM> buttons let you cycle through the classifications, and the
<EM>Color function for</EM> <B>x</B> menu lets you assign the color function to the
currently selected classification.

<P>
The data store in Figure <A HREF="#pipeline">1</A> labeled <EM>Atom Energy</EM> is the energy
calculator plug-in, which provides real-valued energy component terms and
gradient vectors for each atom in the molecule.  These numbers are processed
according to the channel selected to produce a single floating-point value for
each atom.  Only the component terms selected in the discriminator are included.
 If no terms are selected in the discriminator, every atom's value will be zero.
 The number of toggles in the discriminator, <EM>c</EM>, is determined by the
plug-in.  For our AMBER plug-in, <EM>c</EM> = 5.  If, for example, a solvation term
is added to the force field, it will appear in the user interface as a sixth
toggle in the discriminator.

fields of atoms from small classes can be overwhelmed or obscured by large
numbers of atoms in other classes.

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
Adding classifiers and color functions</A>
</H1>

<P>
The classifiers and color functions were implemented in a highly modular way
that makes the process of adding new functions to the source code almost trival.
The actual time required depends on the complexity of the function, but a rich
set of classifiers can easily be created in minutes based on <TT>ProteinShop</TT>'s existing
functionality.  The four files involved in this process are
<TT>AtomClassifier.cpp</TT>, <TT>AtomClassifier.h</TT>, <TT>ColorFunction.cpp</TT>, and
<TT>ColorFunction.h</TT>.  We offer an example for the classifier; the color
function is analogous but simpler.

<P>
The default classifiers are implemented as singleton instances in
<TT>AtomClassifier.cpp</TT>, made available through a static factory method (<TT>AtomClassifier::get()</TT>).  The user interface uses this factory call in
conjunction with <TT>AtomClassifier::numClassifiers()</TT> to initialize the menu
in the <EM>Energy Rendering Dialog</EM>.  To add a new classifier to the system, one only needs to define a
new subclass of AtomClassifier and add it to the singleton array in
<TT>AtomClassifier.cpp</TT>, where one finds a code template of the following form:

<P>
<PRE>
class Classifier : public AtomClassifier
{
public:

    ~Classifier() {}
    uint classify (const MD::Protein::ChainAtom &amp;atom,
                   const ProteinState &amp;proteinState)
    {
    }
    const char *className (uint classNum)
    {
    }
    const char *name()
    {
    }
    uint numClasses()
    {
    }
};
static Classifier f_Singleton;
</PRE>

<P>
To add a new classifier:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Copy and paste this template into the area of <TT>AtomClassifier.cpp</TT>
that contains the other classifiers.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Replace each instance of the string <TT>Classifier</TT> in the copied
template with the name of your new subclass.  Give a unique name to the
singleton instance.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Fill in the function definitions.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Add the address of the singleton instance to the factory array.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
The name functions are important to the user interface; they are used to fill in
the menu lists and dialog labels.  The <TT>numClasses()</TT> function needs to
return one higher than the largest possible value that can be returned by the
<TT>classify()</TT> function.  The <TT>classify()</TT> function can, in turn, be
anything you need for it to be.  You can also add any new members (functions or
data) that your functionality requires.  You can also add new constructors, but
this will probably be be more complex; see below.

<P>
As a simple example, let's implement a new classifier called
<TT>ExampleClassifier</TT> and add it to the system.  This classifier will
distinguish atoms belonging to Proline residues from all others.  As such, it
makes two classes, called <EM>Proline</EM> and <EM>Not Proline</EM>.  The classifier
itself will be called the <EM>Proline Partition</EM>.  Following steps 1, 2, and 3,
we modify the template to produce the following code:

<P>
<PRE>
class ExampleClassifier : public AtomClassifier
{
public:

    ~ExampleClassifier() {}
    uint classify (const MD::Protein::ChainAtom &amp;atom,
                   const ProteinState &amp;proteinState)
    {
        Protein::Residue *residue = atom.getResidue();
        Protein::Residue::AminoAcid type = residue-&gt;getType();
        if ( type == Protein::Residue::PRO ) return 0;
        else return 1;
    }
    const char *className (uint classNum)
    {
        if ( classNum == 0 ) return "Proline";
        else if ( classNum == 1 ) return "Not Proline";
        else return "&lt;parameter range error&gt;";
    }
    const char *name()
    {
        return "Proline Partition";
    }
    uint numClasses()
    {
        return 2;
    }
};
static ExampleClassifier f_exampleSingleton;
</PRE>

<P>
We take care to ensure that the names returned by <TT>className()</TT> correspond
to the results produced by <TT>classify()</TT>.  In the <TT>classify()</TT> function,
the classifier queries the atom's residue object to determine whether or not it
is the amino acid Proline.  Fortunately (consulting <TT>Protein.h</TT>), class <TT>Protein::ChainAtom</TT> provides direct access to its associated
<TT>Protein::Residue</TT> instance via the <TT>getResidue()</TT> method.  So, all we
have to do is call this function, get the type of amino acid, and evaluate it.

<P>
This brings us to step 4, which requires updating the variables
<TT>f_numDefaultClassifiers</TT> and <TT>f_defaultClassifiers</TT>.  First, increase
the value of <TT>f_numDefaultClassifiers</TT> by one, and then add the address of
the singleton instance to the end of the array.  Thus, if the array used to look
like this:

<P>
<PRE>
static const uint f_numDefaultClassifiers = 3;
static AtomClassifier *f_defaultClassifiers[f_numDefaultClassifiers] = {
    &amp;f_unitySingleton,
    &amp;f_phobiPhilicSingleton,
    &amp;f_hBondSingleton
};
</PRE>

<P>
The updated array will look like this:

<P>
<PRE>
static const uint f_numDefaultClassifiers = 4;
static AtomClassifier *f_defaultClassifiers[f_numDefaultClassifiers] = {
    &amp;f_unitySingleton,
    &amp;f_phobiPhilicSingleton,
    &amp;f_hBondSingleton,
    &amp;f_exampleSingleton
};
</PRE>

<P>
There is a large resource of information contained in class <TT>Protein</TT> that
can be exploited in this manner, but other objects associated with the protein
can be consulted as well, via the <TT>ProteinState</TT> argument.  For example, you
can tap into the settings of its <TT>ProteinRenderer</TT>, or examine its energy
components or force field gradient vectors through its <TT>EnergyCalculator</TT>. 
Note that, to use the <TT>EnergyCalculator</TT>, you need the atom's linear index,
which is not the same as its <TT>atomIndex</TT> property that comes from the PDB
file.  However, this information can be extracted from the <TT>ProteinState</TT>
object - as can everything that <TT>ProteinShop</TT> knows about the atom.  The fields of
<TT>struct ProteinState</TT> are defined in <TT>Globals.h</TT>. Hint:  to get the
linear index, iterate with <TT>Protein::ConstAtomIterator</TT> or add a new
property to <TT>Protein::ChainAtom</TT>.  The latter approach is faster, but it
increases the storage requirement.

<P>
Adding a constructor to the classifier might compilicate the process somewhat,
while adding additional methods will almost certainly require additional coding
outside of <TT>AtomClassifier.cpp</TT>.  We will address these issues separately.

<P>
<B>Constructors</B>:  If you add a new constructor, and this constructor is safe
to execute during the static initializer, you can follow the implementation
pattern set forth above.  If your new constructor takes no arguments, you can
follow the pattern above exactly.  If your new constructor takes arguments, and
your arguments are available when the static initializer runs, and the number of
different ways the constructor can meaningully be called is fairly limited, you
can add one singleton for each of these possible constructor calls.  For
example, if your constructor takes an enumerated type with three possible
values, you can define one singleton for each possible value of the enumeration:

<P>
<PRE>
static ExampleClassifier2 f_x2fooSingleton (ENUM_VALUE_FOO);
static ExampleClassifier2 f_x2barSingleton (ENUM_VALUE_BAR);
static ExampleClassifier2 f_x2bazSingleton (ENUM_VALUE_BAZ);

static const uint f_numDefaultClassifiers = 7;
static AtomClassifier *f_defaultClassifiers[f_numDefaultClassifiers] = {
    &amp;f_unitySingleton,
    &amp;f_phobiPhilicSingleton,
    &amp;f_hBondSingleton,
    &amp;f_exampleSingleton,
    &amp;f_x2fooSingleton,
    &amp;f_x2barSingleton,
    &amp;f_x2bazSingleton
};
</PRE>

<P>
<B>Additional methods</B>:  If your constructor is much more complicated than
that, or if it requires additional configuration after construction, you will
need to add intialization code somewhere else in <TT>ProteinShop</TT> and add the
classifier(s) to the factory with the secondary initializer
<TT>AtomClassifier::add()</TT>.  (You can also remove these via
<TT>AtomClassifier::remove()</TT>).  Whenever you call the <TT>add()</TT> or
<TT>remove()</TT> methods for classifiers or color functions, the list of objects
available in the factory changes, so you will <EM>also</EM> need to reinitialize
the user interface widgets that display these lists to the end user (no nice
event notification model here, it's all done with callbacks).  These lists are
loaded and reloaded by the function <TT>initializeVolumeDialogChoices()</TT> (close
to the top of <TT>ProteinFltk.cpp</TT>).  At the time of this writing, this
function is only called from <TT>loadEnergyLibrary()</TT>, but you should call it
any time after changing the name of a function or classification, or after
making one or more calls to <TT>add()</TT> or <TT>remove()</TT> in the classifier or
color function factories.

<P>
The reason these hooks were built into the system is to allow the creation of
user-editable functions.  Such a function would provide its own user interface
(accessed either from a menu or through an existing dialog) and allow the user
to create modifiable instances of some general function type.  It is in support
of such features that you might need to put additional methods in your subclass.
 As a simple example, a classifier that partitions the elements into two sets
might allow the user to edit the membership of these sets by means of a checkbox
list.  As a more complex example, the editor of a compound classifier might
allow the user to specify one input classifier, and then associate each element
of that input's range with another classifier.  Note that, in both of these
examples, it is probably easier to hard-code them than build a fancy GUI, unless
large numbers of different instances (partitions or compounds, in the cases of
these examples) are commonly in use.

<P>
Of course, the implementation of such nice things will undoubtedly lead to
demands for more features, like generalized loading and saving of classifier and
color function instances to files, etc.  You might want to build new interfaces
on top of the existing ones to get some code reuse out of that.
